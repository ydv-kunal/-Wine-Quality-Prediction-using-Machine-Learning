##Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains physicochemical properties of wines (such as acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, etc.) along with a quality score given by wine tasters.

The goal is to classify wines into Good (quality ≥ 7) and Not Good (quality < 7) categories. This binary classification makes the model more practical and easier to evaluate compared to multi-class classification.
